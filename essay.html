        Akhmatova was heavily connected to the modernist movement, though she continued to write poetry for over two
        decades after the end of the era. She was one of the founders of the Acmeist school of poetry, along with other
        famed Russian modernists such as Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky. Acmeism was a reactionary movement to
        the dominant school of poetry in Russia at the time, known as Symbolism. The Symbolists were known to use words
        to espouse highly romantic ideals and imagery, resulting in poetry that could be described as vague. Acmeism,
        taken from the greek “akme”(the best age of man or the time of flowering) sought to reject this notion. They
        would clear, precise words in order to elicit a very clear image. This movement was incredibly similar to
        another modernist movement in western Europe known as Imagism, which is more well known. In fact, Acmeism can
        probably be described as Russian Imagism.

      <p class="lead">
        As Akhmatova was so heavily involved with this movement that was unapologetically modernist, one must consider
        her to be a modernist. Though her style would evolve greatly over the coming years, and past the modernist age,
        her roots would remain firmly in Acmeism, even if she would take on grander, more widespread themes.
