          Anna Akhmatova is the most influential poet of twentieth century Russia, but in the United States of America,
          she
          is virtually unknown to the general populace. There were dozens of modernist Russian poets which we could have
          chosen from, but Akhmatova provided us with the most opportunity for many reasons. This provides us with lots
          of
          content to create unique ideas and interpretations of her poetry and life story.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Despite her lack of presence in the American mind, Akhmatova’s life and her work are very well documented, and
          thoroughly researched. She witnessed the fall of the Tsarist regime and the rise of the Soviet Union, and then
          suffered under Stalin’s tyrannical rule for decades. Her insight into the mindset of the Russian people during
          this early Soviet period is unparalleled; none understood the nature of suffering and oppression better than
          Akhmatova. People of all nations can find relatable messages and themes in her poetry. She was also extremely
          versatile. In one poem she would explore the intricacies of unrequited love, and in another she would be
          prophesying the fate of Russia. Akhmatova was also one of the founders of the Acmeist movement, which is
          perhaps
          the pinnacle of Russian modernism. By researching and exploring Akhmatova’s life and her works, scholars gain
          a
          more complete view of modernism.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          It didn’t take long to decide that a website was best for portraying Akhmatova and all of her accomplishments.
          Denis had experience in creating them, so we knew we could deliver a high quality artifact that effectively
          conveyed the information we wanted it to convey. Using a website, we could portray content in very creative
          ways.
          For instance, we wanted to present the poems in their native Russian and also an English translation of each
          piece. Using a website, it was easy to make a navigable page that allowed the viewer to see the English and
          Russian versions of each poem. From all of the poetry meetings we attended, we learned the value of hearing a
          poem
          in its native language, so we added an audio aspect to the presentation of the poems by providing audio
          recordings
          of each one. Denis’s Russian skills made this very convenient.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          A website exudes more sophistication than a mere PowerPoint or podcast. A PowerPoint is rather linear - one
          can
          only go forwards and backwards, and a podcast is very similar. With a website, one can explore. They can click
          on
          the tabs that have information they believe will be interesting, rather than just mindlessly listening to a
          podcast or scrolling through a PowerPoint. We can provide contextual information in convenient side windows as
          the
          viewer reads about the life of Akhmatova. In essence, websites offer more choice than other alternatives, and
          are
          highly customizable. This customizability makes a website perfect to present Akhmatova in a way we found
          satisfying.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Her life was bleak, and thus the website had to reflect this. We used very muted colors; indeed, any color
          other
          than black or white or gray is rather rare in the entire presentation. Akhmatova was distinctly Russian in the
          way
          she identified herself and in her poetry, always advocating for the preservation of the Russian language. So,
          it
          would have been criminal to not include any Russian text at all. After receiving some more feedback, we
          decided
          to
          accent the website with red, further enforcing our poet’s connection with Russia, as well as making the
          website
          more visually appealing while still maintaining a somber mood.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Overall, the website accomplished a lot of the objectives it set out to complete. For one, the minimalist
          design
          emphasizes Anna Akhmatova’s close association with her motherland, and the bleakness that was the subject of
          both
          her life and her poetry. We performed well when it came to displaying Akhmatova’s life, especially when it
          came
          to
          presenting relevant historical information, which is crucial to fully understanding Akhmatova. We presented
          her
          poetry in a way that was true to the source material, yet also comprehensible for the reader. Her poems might
          be
          difficult to understand without some proper context, but that’s what the analysis is for. The one thing we
          truly
          regret is that we couldn’t have more of her poems on the website, because many of her works are simply
          amazing.
          We
          also couldn’t include some of her more important works because they are simply too long and would ruin the
          layout
          of the website, which is highly regrettable but completely necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Max began his research by attempting to collect as much general information on Akhmatova as he could. This
          included biographical content, some of her poetry in both Russian and English, and also analyses of her poetry
          by
          scholars. JSTOR was the main database Max utilized for this grueling process. By reading through many of these
          sources, he would learn about some of her renowned poems, and from there he would be sent on a long quest to
          find
          that poem in both English and Russian. Sometimes, it could be quite difficult to find the poem in its original
          cyrillic script. Her most famous poem, Requiem, was quite illusive. Eventually he found a reading of it on
          YouTube
          with a link to the original poem in the description.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Standard biographical information was simpler to find, but what was truly necessary were some primary and
          secondary sources.This required even more browsing of JSTOR, this time specifically searching for the poet’s
          name
          and ‘letters’. Letters are excellent primary sources, and so it seemed only logical to find some that provided
          more concrete context to Akhmatova’s life. Most of the letters found were written between Akhmatova and her
          first
          husband, and no English translations of them could be found. Thus, Max had hit a dead end, though this was
          only
          a
          small setback. Once again, he began to generally search Akhmatova’s name, and came across the transcript of an
          interview with one Tomas Venclova, a Lithuanian poet who had been an acquaintance of Akhmatova. This provided
          lots
          of insight into Akhmatova’s character and smaller details in her life.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Ewan started his research with a broad overview of Russian/Soviet history that coincided with Anna Akhmatova’s
          lifetime. Looking up timelines of Russian history from the 1890s to 1960s helped differentiate relevant
          historical
          events from the irrelevant ones. History.com was a useful source for finding general information on specific
          events and also timelines, and Encyclopædia Britannica was a very helpful source for more in-depth historical
          analysis. Since Anna Akhmatova was born in 1889 and did not start writing until later in her life, it only
          made
          sense to begin the research at the beginning of the 20th century. Arguably the most politically important
          event
          in
          Russian history during that time period was the Revolution of 1905, primarily because it was the main cause of
          the
          Russian Revolution of 1917.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Prior to the Russian Revolution was the beginning of World War I, and because of Max’s research, Ewan was
          aware
          of
          the fact that Anna Akhmatova had written poetry on Russia’s involvement in the war (her perspective primarily
          negative). It turns out that Russian patriotism via literature in World War I is an extensively researched
          topic,
          so it was relatively easy to find a scholarly source that included the various ways that Russian poets viewed
          the
          war, including Akhmatova.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          When it came to researching the politically and socially complex Russian Revolution and ensuing Russian Civil
          War,
          Encyclopædia Britannica proved to be a helpful source once again that provided important historical context
          and
          facts. Another source that Ewan only knew of because of his research for the poster project, International
          Encyclopedia of the First World War, was vital in learning the nuances of these events. Alexandre Sumpf wrote
          an
          extensive, 4-section article chronicling the facets of the February Revolution, October Revolution, and the
          Russian Civil War. This allowed me to better understand the reasons behind the events, and their repercussions
          in
          later Soviet history.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Considering that some of Akhmatova’s most famous works are from under the Stalin dictatorship, it only made
          sense
          to extensively research the policies of Stalinist Russia and their effects on Soviet life. Encyclopedia
          Britannica
          was useful yet again with its article by Dominic Lieven chronicling the entirety of the Stalin Era from 1928
          to
          1953. The article went in depth in the policies affecting culture, economics, politics, and censorship, all of
          which are related to the consumption of literature.
