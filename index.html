            The Russian Empire under Tsarist rule had progressed much slower than its Western neighbors in
            industrialization.
            By the time Russia began industrializing in the late 19th century, the country
            was plagued by social, political, and economic unrest. An embarrassing failure in the
            Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), a rapid increase in population due to industrialization, and an ensuing food
            shortages, led to the Russian Revolution of 1905. Revolutionaries consisted of Socialists, Marxists, and
            Center-Liberals who recognized the need for change in the government. While the Tsar was not overthrown, he
            was forced to compromise in the form of the October Manifesto, which created an elected national legislature
            named the Duma. No legislation could be passed without the approval of the Duma, therefore limiting the
            Tsar’s autocratic powers. However, the Duma's authority was quickly undermined by the Tsar, and this would
            prove only a band-aid to a glaringly large wound, due to the events of the following decade.

            Russia entered the World War in defense of Serbia against Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1914. While not
            obligated to do so, Russian leaders had a political motivation, as a failure to aid Serbia would make Russia
            appear
            weak, thereby losing any chance of controlling the Balkans. Russia was easily outmatched in terms of
            firepower compared to its enemies: Germany had industrialized far faster and earlier than Russia, and its
            armies were much better equipped. Despite this, Russian forces scored several victories in key battles and
            were successful in diverting German manpower to the Eastern Front. Eventually casualties proved to be too
            high, and
            the war effort became increasingly demoralizing. By 1915, many Russian soldiers were deployed to the
            battlefield without basic equipment like a firearm or boots due to equipment shortages, and were told to
            simply pick up weapons they found. Russia had the largest casualties among any of the combatants, suffering
            roughly 3.3
            million deaths. The war had stirred even more food shortages, the government appeared more corrupt than ever
            due to
            influencers like Rasputin, and the Duma, the powerless Russian Parliment, was repeatedly dissolved by the
            Tsar.
            This directly led to the Revolutions of 1917

            The February Revolution began on March 8th, 1917. Industrial workers, many of them women, were on strike in
            the streets.
            Peasants were clamoring for bread. Theyformed large crowds and began to protest around the area of the
            capital.
            The workers went into the streets, chanting: "Down with Autocracy!"" and "Down with War!" On March 11th, the
            Tsar ordered
            the Petrograd police to fire upon the protestors, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The
            scale of the demonstrations and a lack of faith in the Tsar caused the police to waiver, and by March 12th,
            the
            Duma formed a new provisional government. On March 15th, Tsar Nicholas formally abdicated the throne. The
            autocratic, conservative monarchy was overthrown and succeeded by a liberal, progressive Provisional
            Government that seemed to support democratization.

            While the February Revolution had succeeded in overthrowing centuries of autocratic rule in Russia, the
            Provisional Government that formed was composed primarily of the wealthy, land-owning
            bourgeois. The government continued the war effort on the Eastern Front, which only worsened food shortages.
            Bolsheviks, who represented much of the poor working class, were frustrated by the liberal ideologies and
            ineffectiveness of the Provisional Government and desired Communism, not Liberalism. The Bolsheviks
            established
            the Petrograd Soviet, or Petrograd Worker's Union, to rival the Provisional Government, and on November
            6th, the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, executed a coup on the Provisional Government, and
            had seized most government offices after just two days. By November 8th, Vladimir Lenin had become
            the leader of Communist Russia, but his power was by no means solidified, as Russia was plunged into the
            Russian Civil War.

            factions formed the Red Army. The five year conflict was arguably a continuation of World War I, as the
            Bolshevik government signed a treaty with the German forces to escape the rising economic and death toll.
            Russia’s withdrawal meant the collapse of the Eastern Front, and consequently the Allied Powers were
            politically motivated to support the White Army in hopes that they would prevail and reenter the war. The
            The Red Army’s effective victory by 1921 solidified the Bolsheviks
            as the sole political party within Russia, at the cost of roughly 7,000,000 casualties, mostly civilians.

            The Russian Civil War (1917-1923) ended with the Red Army (Bolsheviks) establishing the Soviet Union, and
            the
            White Army (capitalists, monarchists, social democrats) collapsed. Vladimir Lenin was solidified as the
            Chairman of the Soviet Union and the Bolshevik-dominated government began its sweeping reforms. After the
            short-lived War Communism policy (forced requisition led to many peasant revolts and therefore a food
            shortage), Lenin’s government shifted to the New Economic Policy (NEP), a reform that provided room for
            entrepreneurs to establish private businesses in smaller industries. The majority of key industries remained
            under state control, and monetary reform in 1923 ended the despised forced requisitions. While the NEP was a
            successful short term solution, the end-goal of a fully socialist economy remained to be achieved. Lenin’s
            death in 1924 moved the goal further to the future as the question of succession was rampant for several
            years, until Stalin took power.

            millions. It was under Stalin’s reign that the gulag system became most prominent. Under this system,
            roughly eighteen million people were sent to forced labor camps in Siberia. Anyone could go to the gulags,
            from petty criminals to political dissenters. Stalin was an extreme Russian nationalist, propagandist, and
            advocated for arguably the most
            censorship out of any leader in the history of the USSR. Under his leadership, the Soviet Union also became
            one of the world’s two superpowers, and anti-Communist policy from Western powers in the Cold War
            contributed to his tightening of control over the USSR.

            was immensly important to Allied vicoty, as Nazi Germany had routed a significant amount of resources to the

        <p class="lead" id='prewar'>
          Anna Akhmatova is one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century, but in the West, hardly a soul knows
          her name. This is quite tragic, as in the eyes of many scholars, she is seen as a social prophet. As one of
          the
          firsthand witnesses to the rise of the Soviet Union and the subsequent tyrannical rule of Joseph Stalin,
          Akhmatova was able to provide incredible insight on the subjects of suffering and oppression. In many ways,
          she
          was the silent, anguished voice of the entire Russian people during Stalin’s reign of terror.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p class="lead" id='prewar'>
          Anna Akhmatova was born Anna Andreevna Gorenko on June 11, 1889 at Bolshoy Fontan, a small town on the Black
          Sea, though when she was very young her family moved to a small town called Tsarkoye Selo, outside of St.
          Petersburg. Her family was upper-class, descending from both Russian and Ukrainian royalty. She began to write
          poetry when she was eleven years old, where her main inspiration was one of Russia’s other great poets:
          Aleksandr Pushkin.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='prewar'>
          In 1903 she met her first husband, Nikolay Gumilev, with whom she would have her first and only child in 1912.
          Later on in her life, her son would be forced in and out of prison by the Soviet regime, and this had a great
          influence on much of Akhmatova’s work.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='ww1'>
          In 1910, Akhmatova teamed with famed Russian poets Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky to form the Guild of
          Poets, going on to create the Acmeist school of poetry, a direct response to the symbolist school that had
          dominated Russian Poetry for decades. It was in these years between 1910 and the start of the First World War
          that Anna Akhmatova became well known to the Russian people with the publishing of her first collection of
          poetry known as Vecher (Evening in English).
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='ww1'>
          Akhmatova lived a very Bohemian lifestyle prior to the First World War. Due to the absence of her husband, who
          constantly partook in expeditions to Africa, she had many affairs. Still, she was well respected and loved by
          the Russian intelligentsia for her good looks and charming nature. Her second book, Chetki (Rosary in English)
          was the most popular of her books during this time. The poems in both Vecher and Chetki both tackle the
          intensely personal and intricate aspects of love.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p class="lead" id='feb-r'>
          When the First World War broke out, there was a distinct shift in the poetry of Anna Akhmatova. Gone were the
          poems which spoke of unrequited love and penitence for a bohemian lifestyle; Akhmatova’s poetry began to take
          on
          a more prophetic stance. She saw World War One as a spiritual event, “retribution for the indifference shown
          by
          the intelligentsia and upper classes towards the suffering of the common people." She predicted
          horror and terror would be the future of Russia.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='feb-r'>
          Of course, we wouldn’t be calling Akhmatova a prophet today if she were wrong. After Russia’s horrible
          failures
          in the war, the tsarist regime was overthrown, and the Bolsheviks came to power. Boris Anwerp, a close friend
          of
          Anna Akhmatova, recollected her initial reaction to the revolution.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='oct-r'>
          “She was excited and said we must expect more changes in our lives. The same thing’s going to happen that
          occurred in France during the Revolution, but maybe even worse.”
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='cw'>
          It was around this time that Anna Akhmatova had to make a decision: leave Russia, like many of the
          intelligentsia, so that she could escape the constraints and oppression of the Bolshevik regime, or stay in
          her
          homeland. She made the decision to stay: for better or for worse. The difficulty of her decision is captured
          in
          the poem <i>When in suicidal anguish.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id='lenin'>
          During the course of the Russian Civil War, Akhmatova was moved to Sheremet’ev Palace by the Bolshevik
          government. Many prominent scholars and artists which they saw as possibly helpful to the revolutionary
          movement
          were housed in the palace. As the Bolsheviks were busy fighting the civil war and participated little in
          artistic life. This gave Akhmatova the opportunity to attend many poetry readings and write poetry. Most of
          the
          themes of these poems concern the loss of friends, specifically those who had emigrated out of Russia due to
          the
          rise of the Soviets. Akhmatova truly believed that in order for a poet to maintain their art, they must be in
          their native land, and so she strongly opposed emigration.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id="lenin">
          Throughout the course of the 1920s, Akhmatova would lament the fact that she had gained nothing from the
          revolution. Indeed, she had lost many of her close friends and the bohemian culture that she enjoyed so much
          prior to the war was completely gone. It was also infinitely more difficult to produce and publish the poetry
          she wanted to because of the ever-present Bolshevik government. Poets who had chosen not to emigrate found
          themselves in a tough position. They had to accommodate to the whims of the new regime in order to stay
          relevant, or they had to “remain consciously on the periphery” (Reeder 8). Sadly, by 1925 no one was
          publishing
          her work and she became irrelevant in Russia. For much of the 1920s-1940s, many people in the West considered
          her to be dead or missing because practically none of her poetry would ever be published outside of Russia,
          and
          it was barely ever published in her own country.

        <p class="lead" id="stalin">
          Life became increasingly difficult for Akhmatova under the reign of Joseph Stalin. Her first husband had been
          executed by the Cheka (the first Soviet secret police organization in 1921) for holding anti-communist views.
          Due to this, their son, Lev Gumilev, would constantly be accused of being anti-regime and forced into prison
          on
          and off for most of the 1930s up until the 1950s. This was an incredibly painful time for Anna Akhmatova. What
          friends she had left were routinely arrested by the secret police and sent to Siberia; she always feared that
          she would be the next victim, and of course, she couldn’t stop worrying for her son. Famed Lithuanian poet,
          Tomas Vencolva said of this time “The Stalinist terror was a sort of lottery; one might be completely loyal
          and
          might perish nevertheless”(Venclova and Hinsey 5). Since none of her work was published, hardly any money was
          coming in, and so she lived in poverty.
        </p>
        <p class="lead" id="ww2">
          It is this experience, under the tyrannical rule of Stalin, that influenced Akhmatova to chronicle and truly
          capture the feeling of fear and oppression that the Russian people had under Stalin’s regime. She never quite
          stopped writing poetry. Indeed, between 1935 and 1961, she composed her most famous work, translated as
          Requiem
          in English. The poem was composed under incredible circumstances. Since she was terrified of the secret police
          finding the poem and unleashing another wave of arrests on her fellow poets, she would whisper lines from the
          poem to her close friend, Lydia Chukovskaya, who would memorize every single word. Akhmatova would then burn
          the
          poem in an ashtray. Chukovskaya would later recount this process as ritualistic in her now famous Akhmatova
          Journals, saying, “It was a ritual: hands, match, ashtray - a beautiful and mournful ritual.” The poem was
          first
          published in Russia in 1989, during perestroika.

          During World War Two, Anna Akhmatova did her best to support the Russian people in their war against the Third
          Reich. Despite the abysmal treatment she had received from her country, Akhmatova was a patriot. She
          particularly advocated for the preservation of the Russian language, and was known to recite verse at military
          hospitals in Tashkent, where the government had sent her when the war broke out. Due to the government’s focus
          on the war, Akhmatova was able to publish her Izbrannoe (Selected Poems), and because her son had taken part
          in
          the war by helping capture Berlin, he was allowed to return to university.

          Alas, these improvements in her life did not last for long. In 1945 and 1946 she received visits from the
          British scholar Isaiah Berlin. While she thoroughly enjoyed the conversations with the philosopher, they
          brought
          the attention of the government. The government criticized her work as “bourgeois” and “decadent”. She lost
          many
          of the privileges the Soviet government awarded to artists, and she once again struggled to stay alive. To
          make
          matters infinitely worse, her son was rearrested again in 1949.

          Akhmatova became so desperate to get her son out of prison again that she began to write poetry that praised
          Stalin’s government and praised the Soviet Union. This did not work.
          When Stalin died in 1953, life gradually started to become easier for Akhmatova. Nikita Kruschev denounced
          Stalin’s reign as tyrannical and government restrictions on artistic pursuits became less severe. In the late
          1950s and early 1960s, some of Akhmatova’s poetry from years prior was published, though censored by the
          government. Her son was released from prison for the last time in 1956.

          The famed Lithuanian poet, Tomas Venclova, was acquainted with Akhmatova during this period. He said of her
          “In
          the 1960s, she was literally besieged by young people who wished to acquaint her with their scribblings and
          hoped for encouragement from her”(Venclova and Hinsey 5). From this, one can deduce that Akhmatova’s fame had
          been somewhat restored, and was a huge influence on new, aspiring poets.

          She was allowed to make two trips abroad to accept a Poetry prize in Italy and to accept an honorary doctorate
          from Oxford. Anna Akhmatova died in 1966 of a heart attack.

          It wasn’t until the late 1980s that Akhmatova became fully recognized for her poetry in her own country. By
          this
          time, the Soviet Union was disintegrating and many of her past works were being published. Akhmatova’s
          reputation in Russia is legendary today. No other poet had managed to capture the collective terror and
          numbness
          that all of Russia felt during Stalin’s rule quite like she had. She was the one quiet voice for millions who
          suffered and feared on a daily basis. Her prophetic nature and deep understanding of human suffering were
          unparalleled.
